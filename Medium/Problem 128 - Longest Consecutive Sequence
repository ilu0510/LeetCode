#Problem 128 - Longest Consecutive Sequence

#Problem Description
'''
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

#Thought Process
'''
The easiest way is to sort it, but this would be very slow. 
What I will build is a dictionary with the key being the index of the nums[i] and the value would be nums[i]. I ask whether the number is one more than any of the numbers in the dictionary;
if yes, append the numbers to a results array. This would mean I can do the algorithm in one sweep, giving me a time and space complexity of O(n). I then need to just return the length of the array. 
The issue with this is that it will just recognise the first consecutive array. We need to rebuild this. 
I should stick with the dictionary and once it is all collected, I need to cleverly interrogate.
Actually it should be quicker if I can get rid of duplicates first, so I will use a set() for the hashmap. I will then set up a counter that would increment everytime we find a consecutive. I will keep asking
if nums[i]-1 exists in the set; if it does not then we know that it is the start of the sequence... we then check if the nums[i]+1 exists, if it does not then we move on to the next number, and if it does, we
increment a length count to which rests once we find that we cannot go any further.

#Code - Attempt 1
def longestConsecutive(nums):
    h = set(nums)
    chain = 0
    for i in h:
        length = 1
        while (i+length) in h:
            length += 1
        chain = max(length, chain)
    
    return chain
        

    


print(longestConsecutive([2,3,6,5,5]))
